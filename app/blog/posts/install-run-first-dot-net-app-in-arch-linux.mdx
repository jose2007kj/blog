Blazor WebAssembly is a popular framework for building interactive web applications using C# instead of JavaScript. In this guide, we will walk you through the steps to install the .NET SDK and ASP.NET Core runtime on Arch Linux and create your first Blazor WebAssembly application.

## Step 1: Add Microsoftâ€™s Repository

To ensure you have access to the latest .NET SDK packages, add the Microsoft repository to your `pacman` configuration:

1. Open the `pacman` configuration file:

    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/pacman.conf
    ```

2. Add the following lines at the bottom of the file:

    ```plaintext
    [dotnet]
    Server = https://packages.microsoft.com/archlinux/core/$arch
    ```

3. Save and close the file.

## Step 2: Install .NET SDK and ASP.NET Runtime

Use the AUR helper `yay` to install the necessary .NET packages:

1. Install the .NET SDK:

    ```bash
    yay -S dotnet-sdk
    ```

2. Install the ASP.NET Core runtime:

    ```bash
    yay -S aspnet-runtime
    ```

## Step 3: Create a New Blazor WebAssembly App

Now that the .NET SDK and runtime are installed, create a new Blazor WebAssembly app:

1. Use the .NET CLI to create a new app:

    ```bash
    dotnet new blazorwasm -o MyBlazorApp
    ```

2. Navigate to the app directory:

    ```bash
    cd MyBlazorApp
    ```

## Step 4: Build and Run the Application

Build and run your Blazor WebAssembly app:

1. Build the app:

    ```bash
    dotnet build
    ```

2. Run the app:

    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```

## Step 5: Access Your Application

Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to see your Blazor WebAssembly app in action!

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you can easily set up a Blazor WebAssembly development environment on Arch Linux. With your first app running, you're ready to explore more of what Blazor has to offer for building modern web applications using C# and .NET!
